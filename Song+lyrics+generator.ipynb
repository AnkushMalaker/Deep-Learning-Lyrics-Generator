out of  \\nSight as things collide  \\nBridges burning softly in the night  \\nAnd you have this way of falling in and out of  \\nTime as it goes by  \\nPassing silently with no goodbye  \\n  \\nAnd I\\'ve spoken with all the other angels  \\nThey don\\'t know what to do  \\nAnd I agree with them whole-heartedly, I do  \\n  \\nTelegram came today from a friend  \\nSaying, \"Where in the hell have you been?  \\nWhere are you goin\\'? \"  \\nI said, \"I don\\'t know, does the loneliness show?  \\nAnd if so does it ever end? \"  \\n  \\nAnd I\\'ve spoken with all the other angels  \\nThey don\\'t know what to do  \\nAnd I agree with them whole-heartedly, I do  \\n  \\nYou have this way of meaning everything and nothing to me  \\nAt the same time  \\nReturning my hellos with goodbyes  \\n  \\n\\'Cause I\\'ve spoken with all the other angels  \\nThey don\\'t know what to do  \\nAnd I agree with them whole-heartedly, I do...  \\n  \\n\\'Cause I\\'ve spoken with all the other angels  \\nThey don\\'t know what to do  \\nAnd I agree with them whole-heartedly, I do...  \\n  \\nAnd I\\'ve spoken with all the other angels  \\nThey don\\'t know what to do  \\nAnd I agree with them whole-heartedly, I do\\n\\nFrom the moment the lights went off  \\nEverything had changed  \\nLie awake in an empty room  \\nIn my head it all feels the same  \\n  \\nLike the taste of the day you left  \\nIt still lingers on my breath  \\nAnd the dampness of tears that left  \\nThe stain where you had wept  \\n  \\nAll alone with the negligee  \\nThat still hangs off of my bed  \\nI keep meaning to give it away  \\nBut I just leave it there instead  \\n  \\n[Chorus]  \\nNo need to cry about it  \\nI cannot live without it  \\nEvery time I wind up back at your door  \\nWhy do you do this to me?  \\nYou penetrate right through me  \\nEvery time I wind up back at your door  \\n  \\nThree more days till I see your face  \\nI\\'m afraid it\\'s far too much  \\nCook a meal and fix up the place  \\nDial your number, hang it up  \\n  \\nIf I took you for granted  \\nI apologize for acting tough  \\nYou\\'re my reason for living  \\nAnd there\\'s no way I\\'m giving up, oh  \\n  \\n[Chorus]  \\n  \\nNow, every evening is a bitter fight  \\nAnd I\\'m eating home alone on a Friday night  \\nAnd I know what your friends say  \\n\"He\\'s just wasting your love and time.\"  \\nI will never let you change your mind  \\n  \\n[Chorus x 2]  \\n  \\nEvery time I wind up back at your door  \\nEvery time I wind up back at your door\\n\\nI count the ways I let you down  \\nOn my fingers and toes but I\\'m running out  \\nClever words can\\'t help me now  \\nI grip you tight but you\\'re slipping out  \\n  \\nAnd I remember your eyes were so bright  \\nWhen I first I met you, so in love that night  \\nAnd now I\\'m kissing your tears goodnight  \\nAnd I can\\'t take it, you\\'re even perfect when you cry  \\nBeautiful goodbye, bye bye, bye bye  \\nIt\\'s dripping from your eyes (bye bye, bye bye),  \\nYour beautiful goodbye (bye bye, bye bye)  \\nIt\\'s dripping from your eyes (bye bye, bye bye), oh yeah  \\n  \\nWhen did the rain become a storm  \\nWhen did the clouds begin to form  \\nYeah we got knocked off course by a natural force  \\nAnd well, we\\'ll be swimming when it\\'s gone  \\n  \\nAnd I remember your eyes were so bright  \\nWhen I first I met you, so in love that night  \\nAnd now I\\'m kissing your tears goodnight  \\nAnd I can\\'t take it, you\\'re even perfect when you cry  \\nBeautiful goodbye, bye bye, bye bye  \\nIt\\'s dripping from your eyes (bye bye, bye bye),  \\nYour beautiful goodbye whoa (bye bye, bye bye)  \\nIt\\'s dripping from your eyes (bye bye, bye bye), oh yeah  \\n  \\nAll the pain you try to hide  \\nShows through your mascara lines as they stream down from your eyes  \\nAnd let \\'em go, let \\'em fly  \\nHolding back won\\'t turn back time  \\nBelieve me, I\\'ve tried  \\n  \\nYour eyes were so bright  \\nAnd I remember your eyes were so bright  \\nI remember your eyes were so bright  \\nWhen I first I met you, how in love were we that night  \\nAnd now I\\'m kissing your tears goodnight  \\nAnd I can\\'t take it, you\\'re even perfect when you cry  \\nBeautiful goodbye (bye bye, bye bye), oh yeah  \\nIt\\'s dripping from your eyes (bye bye, bye bye),  \\nYour beautiful goodbye (bye bye, bye bye), whoa  \\nIt\\'s dripping from your eyes (bye bye, bye bye), yeah yeah  \\n  \\nBeau, oh yeah\\n\\nI never knew perfection till  \\nI heard you speak, and now it kills me  \\nJust to hear you say the simple things  \\nNow waking up is hard to do  \\nAnd sleeping\\'s impossible, too  \\nEverything is reminding me of you  \\nWhat can I do?  \\n  \\n[Chorus]  \\nIt\\'s not right, not okay  \\nSay the word that you say  \\nMaybe we\\'re better off this way  \\nI\\'m not fine, I\\'m in pain  \\nIt\\'s harder everyday  \\nMaybe we\\'re better off this way  \\nIt\\'s better that we break  \\n  \\nA fool to let you slip away  \\nI chase you just to hear you say  \\nYou\\'re scared and that you think that I\\'m insane  \\n  \\nThe city looks so nice from here  \\nPity, I can\\'t see it clearly  \\nWhile you\\'re standing there, it disappears  \\nIt disappears  \\n  \\n[Chorus]  \\n  \\nSaw you sitting all alone  \\nYou\\'re fragile, and you\\'re cold  \\nBut that\\'s all right  \\nLife these days is getting rough  \\nThey\\'ve knocked you down and beat you up  \\nBut it\\'s just a roller coaster anyway, yeah  \\n  \\n[Chorus]  \\n  \\nI\\'m not fine, not okay  \\nSay the word that you say  \\nMaybe we\\'re better off this way  \\n  \\nI\\'m not fine, and I\\'m in pain  \\nIt\\'s harder everyday  \\nMaybe we\\'re better off this way  \\nIt\\'s better that we break, baby\\n\\nNobody cares

shrouding us in moments unforgettable  \\nYou twist to fit the mold that I am in  \\nBut things just get so crazy, living life gets hard to do  \\nAnd I would gladly hit the road, get up and go if I knew  \\nThat someday it would lead me back to you  \\nThat someday it would lead me back to you  \\n  \\nThat may be all I need  \\nIn darkness, she is all I see  \\nCome and rest your bones with me  \\nDriving slow on Sunday morning  \\nAnd I never want to leave  \\n  \\nFingers trace your every outline  \\nPaint a picture with my hands  \\nBack and forth we sway like branches in a storm  \\nChange the weather, still together when it ends  \\n  \\nThat may be all I need  \\nIn darkness, she is all I see  \\nCome and rest your bones with me  \\nDriving slow on Sunday morning  \\nAnd I never want to leave  \\n  \\nBut things just get so crazy, living life gets hard to do  \\nSunday morning, rain is falling and I\\'m calling out to you  \\nSinging, someday it\\'ll bring me back to you.  \\nFind a way to bring myself back home to you  \\n  \\nThat may be all I need  \\nIn darkness, she is all I see  \\nCome and rest your bones with me  \\nDriving slow on Sunday morning  \\nDriving slow  \\n  \\nIt\\'s flower in your hair  \\nI\\'m a flower in your hair\\n\\nWhere you are seems to be  \\nAs far as an eternity  \\nOutstretched arms, open hearts  \\nAnd if it never ends then when do we start?  \\nI\\'ll never leave you behind  \\nOr treat you unkind  \\nI know you understand  \\nAnd with a tear in my eye  \\nGive me the sweetest goodbye  \\nThat I ever did receive  \\n  \\n[Chorus]  \\nPushing forward and arching back  \\nBring me closer to heart attack  \\nSay goodbye and just fly away  \\nWhen you come back  \\nI have some things to say  \\n  \\nHow does it feel to know you never have to be alone  \\nWhen you get home  \\nThere must be someplace here that only you and I could go  \\nSo I can show you how I  \\n  \\nDream away everyday  \\nTry so hard to disregard  \\nThe rhythm of the rain that drops  \\nAnd coincides with the beating of my heart  \\n  \\nI\\'ll never leave you behind  \\nOr treat you unkind  \\nI know you understand  \\nAnd with a tear in my eye  \\nGive me the sweetest goodbye  \\nThat I ever did receive  \\n  \\n[Chorus]  \\n  \\nHow does it feel to know you never have to be alone  \\nWhen you get home  \\nThere must be someplace here that only you and I could go  \\nSo I can show you how I feel\\n\\nI woke up this morning with the burden of love hanging over my head as I  \\nWalked into the living room  \\nSit with you, discuss what\\'s going on  \\nIs it me?  \\nIs it you?  \\nIs it something I forgot to do?  \\nTell me so that I understand  \\n  \\nI just need some time  \\nGather all my thoughts  \\nTo make up for the love I just lost  \\nYou\\'ve been so good to me, given me everything  \\nTake what you want cause it doesn\\'t belong to me  \\n  \\nI woke up this morning with the hurting that I would never ever wish upon  \\nEven my worst enemy  \\nWho is she, what the hell do you people want?  \\nIs it me?  \\nIs it you?  \\nIs it something I forgot to do?  \\nTell me so that I understand  \\n  \\nI just need some time  \\nGather all my thoughts  \\nTo make up for the love I just lost  \\nYou\\'ve been so good to me given me everything  \\nTake what you want cause it doesn\\'t belong to me anyway  \\n  \\nI just need some time  \\nGather all my thoughts  \\nTo make up for the love I just lost  \\nYou\\'ve been so good to me given me everything  \\nTake what you want cause it doesn\\'t belong to me\\n\\nI\\'m full of regret  \\nFor all the things that I have done and said  \\nAnd I don\\'t know if it\\'ll ever be okay to show  \\nMy face \\'round here  \\nSometimes I wonder if I disappear  \\n  \\nWould you ever turn your head and look  \\nTo see if I\\'m gone  \\n\\'Cause I fear  \\n  \\n[Chorus]  \\nThere is nothing left to say to you  \\nThat you want to hear  \\nThat you want to know  \\nI think I should go  \\nThe things I\\'ve done are way too shameful  \\n  \\nYou\\'re just an innocent  \\nA helpless victim of a spider\\'s web  \\nAnd I\\'m an insect  \\nGoing after anything that I can get  \\nSo you\\'d better turn your head and run  \\nAnd don\\'t look back  \\nCause I fear  \\n  \\n[Chorus]  \\n  \\nAnd I have done you so wrong  \\nTreated you bad  \\nStrung you along  \\nOh, shame on myself  \\nI don\\'t know how I got so tangled up  \\n\\'Cause I fear  \\n  \\n[Chorus]\\n\\nShe was a bad thing coming,  \\nBut I did not know.  \\nAnd everytime I came over she told me I had to go.  \\nI said \"Hey, what\\'s going on? I really want to know.\"  \\nShe said \"I cannot tell you now, but I\\'ll call you tomorrow.\"  \\nThat\\'s not enough.  \\nI want more.  \\nI want it all.  \\nI want to bang on your front door.  \\nTurn off the lights  \\nAnd shut out the world.  \\nCause at the end of the day,  \\nAren\\'t we all just boys and girls?  \\nYeah  \\nShe\\'s snake me with sophisication,  \\nSo much class.  \\nShe drinks a Santa margarita,  \\nWould you like a glass?  \\nI don\\'t know how to say no  \\nAnd after three or four,  \\nI was on the floor,  \\nSinging my song,  \\nLa la la  \\nNo no.  \\nThat\\'s not enough.  \\nI want more.  \\nI want it all.  \\nI want to bang on your front door.  \\nTurn off the lights  \\nAnd shut out the world.  \\nCause at the end of the day,  \\nAren\\'t we all just boys and girls?  \\nYeah...  \\nLa la la.  \\nNo no.  \\nThat\\'s not enough.  \\nI want more.  \\nI want it all.  \\nI want to bang on your front door.  \\nTurn off the lights  \\nAnd shut out the world.  \\nCause at the end of the day,  \\nAren\\'t we all just boys and girls?  \\nAren\\'t we all just boys and girls?  \\nAren\\'t we all just boys and girls?

yesterday  \\nI was the man who never lied, oh  \\nI was the man who never lied, oh yeah  \\n  \\nSometimes honesty is the worst policy  \\nHappy ever after, happy ever after  \\nLet it go, you never need to know  \\nI don\\'t wanna be picking up all of these  \\nTiny little pieces, tiny little pieces  \\nOf your heart, won\\'t do it anymore  \\n  \\nI was the man who never lied  \\nI never lied

\\nWalking home  \\nFresh dirt under my fingernails  \\nAnd I can smell hot asphalt  \\nCars screech to a halt to let me pass  \\nAnd I cannot remember  \\nWhat life was like through photographs  \\nTrying to recreate images life gives us from our past  \\n  \\nAnd sometimes it\\'s a sad song  \\n  \\n[Chorus]  \\nBut I cannot forget  \\nRefuse to regret  \\nSo glad I met you and  \\nTake my breath away  \\nMake everyday  \\nWorth all of the pain that I have gone through  \\nAnd Mama I\\'ve been cryin\\'  \\nCause things ain\\'t how they used to be  \\nShe said, \"The battle\\'s almost won  \\nAnd we\\'re only several miles from the sun.\"  \\n  \\nMoving on down my street  \\nI see people I won\\'t ever meet  \\nThink of her, take a breath  \\nFeel the beat in the rhythm of my steps  \\n  \\nAnd sometimes it\\'s a sad song  \\n  \\n[Chorus]  \\n  \\nThe rhythm of her conversation  \\nThe perfection of her creation  \\nThe sex she slipped into my coffee  \\nThe way she felt when she first saw me  \\nHate to love and love to hate her  \\nLike a broken record player  \\nBack and forth and here and gone  \\nAnd on and on and on and on  \\n  \\n[Chorus]\\n\\nI was so high, I did not recognize  \\nThe fire burning in her eyes  \\nThe chaos that controlled my mind  \\nWhispered goodbye as she got on a plane  \\nNever to return again  \\nBut always in my heart  \\n  \\n[Chorus]  \\nThis love has taken it\\'s toll on me  \\nShe said goodbye too many times before  \\nAnd her heart is breaking in front of me  \\nI have no choice \\'cause I won\\'t say goodbye anymore  \\n  \\nI tried my best to feed her appetite  \\nKeep her coming every night  \\nSo hard to keep her satisfied  \\nKept playing love like it was just a game  \\nPretending to feel the same  \\nThen turn around and leave again  \\n  \\n[Chorus]  \\n  \\nI\\'ll fix these broken things  \\nRepair your broken wings  \\nAnd make sure everything is alright  \\nMy pressure on your hips  \\nSinking my fingertips  \\nInto every inch of you  \\n\\'Cause I know that\\'s what you want me to do  \\n  \\n[Chorus]\\n\\nCan you see me  \\nFloating above your head  \\nAs you lay in bed  \\nThinking about everything  \\nThat you did not do  \\nCause saying I love you  \\nHas nothing to do with meaning it  \\n  \\nAnd I don\\'t trust you  \\nCause every time you\\'re here  \\nYour intentions are unclear  \\nI spend every hour waiting for a phone call  \\nThat I know will never come  \\nI used to think you were the one  \\nNow I\\'m sick of thinking anything at all  \\n  \\n[Chorus]  \\nYou ain\\'t ever coming back to me  \\nThat\\'s not how things were supposed to be  \\nYou take my hand just to give it back  \\nNo other lover has ever done that  \\n  \\nDo you remember  \\nThe way we used to melt  \\nDo you remember how it felt  \\nWhen I touched you  \\nCause I remember very well  \\n  \\nAnd how long has it been  \\nSince someone you let in  \\nHas given when I gave to you  \\n  \\nAnd at night when you sleep  \\nDo you dream I would be there  \\nJust for a minute or two  \\nDo you  \\n  \\n[Chorus]  \\n  \\nHeartache, heartache I just have so much  \\nA simple love with a complex touch  \\nThere is nothing you can say or do  \\nI called to let you know I\\'m through with you\\n\\nSee my dear I\\'m thinking of you  \\nMy how she has grown  \\nHer building blocks have all gone home  \\nAnd being there is always where  \\nI\\'ll be  \\nYou\\'ll see  \\n  \\nTake your doll  \\nHouse dreams and make them real  \\nI\\'ve seen the sun  \\nI\\'ll guide your  \\nInspirations along  \\nAnd don\\'t let them stop you from being someone\\'s friend  \\nDon\\'t bend  \\n  \\nI hope you  \\nAlways keep your hand this close to mine  \\nAnd I hope you  \\nNever hesitate to wonder why  \\nWonder why  \\nWonder why  \\nIf you need a shoulder mine is here  \\nAnd I love you  \\nAnd no one can tell you what to do  \\nAnd roses and diamonds could never take  \\nThe place  \\nOf your face  \\nI hope you  \\nNever hesitate to wonder why  \\nWonder why  \\nWonder why\\n\\nThis relationship is over,  \\nThough my stomach still hurts.  \\nAnd now I\\'m gonna live alone,  \\nWhy is the pain much worse?  \\nYou\\'re so much better without makeup,  \\nWhy would you hide your face?  \\nDon\\'t want to spend the night and wake up,  \\nRealize I\\'ve made a big mistake.  \\n  \\n[Chorus]  \\nI can not refuse your eyes,  \\nPlease don\\'t look at me tonight.  \\nMy heart beats fast I know you\\'re there,  \\nAnd I pretend like I don\\'t care.  \\nIt hurts so bad to know the truth,  \\nBut I am still in love with you.  \\n  \\nI never meant to keep you waiting,  \\nAnd now your food is getting cold,  \\nI keep denying I\\'m in love with you,  \\nMy routine is getting old.  \\nAnd now you stand in front of the table,  \\nAnd say you never look back.  \\nYour super stupid when you\\'re angry,  \\nYou only wake up sad.  \\n  \\n[Chorus]  \\n  \\nIt hurts too much to know the truth,  \\nBut I am still in love with you.  \\n  \\nNo more kisses on your lips, tender touch oh please,  \\nI\\'d rather die on my two feet than live down on my knees.  \\nAnd you\\'re the girl to get me over what we start to be  \\nAnd I just cant get over you, and until you\\'re over me.  \\n  \\nI can not refuse your eyes,  \\nPlease don\\'t look at me tonight.  \\nMy heart beats fast I know you\\'re there,  \\nAnd I pretend like I don\\'t care.  \\n  \\n[Chorus]  \\n  \\nIt hurts too much to know the truth,  \\nBut I am still in love with you.\\n\\nSlow is the memory  \\nI can picture her standing right in front of me  \\nI said that I\\'m behaving badly  \\nKinda driving her crazy  \\nBut I know she wants me  \\n  \\nI remember everything  \\nHer sweat, it tastes like sugar cane  \\nAnd sit on top of me, yelling out my fucking name  \\nUntil I\\'m empty  \\nAnd I know she wants me  \\n  \\nBut I have already tried to explain myself  \\nIt\\'s not that I love someone else  \\nBut I can\\'t bear to listen to you cry  \\nI\\'m sick of all these wasted years  \\nDrown in someone else\\'s tears  \\nYou let me down, now I\\'m hanging you out to dry  \\nWhoa, whoa, yeah yeah yeah yeah  \\n  \\nAnd I\\'ll see you when I get back  \\nMaybe we can get ourselves back on the right track  \\nYou touch me there because you know how much I like that  \\nI think that we both need to relax  \\nYou know you want me  \\n  \\nAll the time and everywhere  \\nA happy surface but the underbelly isn\\'t there  \\nAnd the worst thing is that I don\\'t even really care  \\nAnd the emptiness is too much to bear  \\n  \\nBut I have already tried to explain myself  \\nIt\\'s not that I love someone else  \\nBut I can\\'t bear to listen to you cry  \\nI\\'m sick of all these wasted years  \\nDrown in someone else\\'s tears  \\nYou let me down, now I\\'m hanging you out to dry  \\n  \\n\\'Cause sometimes I don\\'t know what to do  \\nI\\'m standing, standing right in front of you  \\nAnd pray our pain subsides  \\nCan\\'t bare the stare of your teary eyes  \\nI know you feel like it\\'s hard to stay  \\nIn fact you may just wanna run away  \\nNow all that I can really say is baby, oh  \\nDeep down you know that  \\n  \\nI have already tried to explain myself  \\nIt\\'s not that I love someone else  \\nBut I can\\'t bear to listen to you cry  \\nI\\'m sick of all these wasted years  \\nDrown in someone else\\'s tears  \\nYou let me down, now I\\'m hanging you out to dry  \\n  \\nI have already tried to explain myself  \\nIt\\'s not that I love someone else  \\nBut I can\\'t bear to listen to you cry  \\nSick of all these wasted years  \\nDrown in someone else\\'s tears  \\nYou let me down, now I\\'m hanging you out
